# MailCrab

Email test server for development, written in Rust.

Inspired by [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) and [MailCatcher](https://mailcatcher.me/).

MailCrab was created as an exercise in Rust, trying out [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) and functional components with [Yew](https://yew.rs/), but most of all because it is really enjoyable to write Rust code.

## TLDR
```
docker run --rm -p 1080:1080 -p 1025:1025 marlonb/mailcrab:latest
```

## Features

- Accept-all SMTP server
- Web interface to view and inspect all incoming email
- View formatted mail, download attachments, view headers or the complete raw mail contents
- Runs on all `amd64` and `arm64` platforms using docker
- Just a 7.77 MB docker image

## Technical overview

Both the backend server and the fontend are written in Rust. The backend receives email over an unencrypted connection on a configurable port. All email is stored in memory while the application is running. An API exposes all received email:

- `/api/messages` return all message metadata
- `/api/message/[id]` returns a complete message, given its `id`
- `/ws` send email metadata to each connected client when a new email is received

The frontend initially performs a call to `/api/messages` to receive all existing email metadata and then subscribes for new messages using the websocket connection. When opening a message, the `/api/message/[id]` endpoint is used to retrieve the complete message body and raw email.

The backend also accepts a few commands over the websocket, to mark a message as opened, to delete a single message or delete all messages.

## Installation and usage

To run MailCrab only docker is required. Start MailCrab using the following command:

```
docker run --rm -p 1080:1080 -p 1025:1025 marlonb/mailcrab:latest
```

Open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:1080](http://localhost:1080) to view the web interface.

### Ports

The default SMTP port is 1025, the default HTTP port is 1080. You can configure the SMTP and HTTP port using environment variables (`SMTP_PORT` and `HTTP_PORT`), or by exposing them on different ports using docker:

```
docker run --rm -p 3000:1080 -p 2525:1025 marlonb/mailcrab:latest
```

###  TLS

You can enable TLS and authentication by setting the enviroment variable `ENABLE_TLS_AUTH=true`. MailCrab will generate a key-pair and print the self-signed certificate. Any username/password combination is accepted. For example:

```
docker run --rm --env ENABLE_TLS_AUTH=true -p 1080:1080 -p 1025:1025 marlonb/mailcrab:latest
```

### Path prefix

You can configure a prefix path for the web interface by setting and environment variable named `MAILCRAB_PREFIX`, for example:

```
docker run --rm --env MAILCRAB_PREFIX=emails -p 1080:1080 -p 1025:1025 marlonb/mailcrab:latest
```

The web interface will also be served at [http://localhost:1080/emails/](http://localhost:1080/emails/)

### docker compose

Usage in a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```
version: "3.8"
services:
    mailcrab:
        image: marlonb/mailcrab:latest
        ports:
            - "1080:1080"
            - "1025:1025"
        networks: [default]
```

## Development

Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) and [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/)

```
# Add wasm as target if it it not present after following the install instructions for Trunk
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# clone the code
git clone git@github.com:tweedegolf/mailcrab.git

# start the backend
cd backend
cargo run

# serve the frontend (in a new terminal window)
cd ../frontend
trunk serve

# optionally send test messages in an interval
cd ../backend
cargo test
```
